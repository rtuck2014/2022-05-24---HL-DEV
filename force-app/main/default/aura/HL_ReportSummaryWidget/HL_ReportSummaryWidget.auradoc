        <p>The Report Summary Widget is used to display dashboard-style widgets that contain useful snippets of summary information.  The data for the widget is provided by a Salesforce Report, and a link is provided that allows the user to see the full report if they desire (possibly with more columns, etc.)</p>

        <p>The Report Summary Widget is added to a Lightning record page using Setup/User Interface/Lightning App Builder.  It is found in the Custom Lightning Components section (left column) under the name "Report Summary Widget".</p>
