<br />
Congratulations on your recent X fundraise and the continued success of your business.<br />
<br />
I am writing from Houlihan Lokey, a global investment bank, where our X group specializes in working with businesses that provide data, analytics and software solutions in the X space. I came across an article that mentioned X's fundraise and I wanted to reach out and propose a 30 minute introductory call.<br />
<br />
We look to build long-term relationships, give advice on a wide range of topics and offer help where we can, connecting companies to funding solutions, and maximizing future growth and valuations.<br />

<br />
<span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia,serif;">We maintain conversations with companies across your sector and frequently work with companies which may represent interesting acquisition opportunities for you.<br />
<br />
Our financial sponsors coverage team is the largest in investment banking, working closely with over 800 alternative investors. We are well-placed to connect you with alternative sources of funding.<br />
<br />
Weâ€™d be delighted to introduce ourselves and hear the X story directly. With this in mind, please let me know when you might have availability for a quick call with a senior member of our team.<br />
<br />
Best wishes,<br />
Dylan<br />
