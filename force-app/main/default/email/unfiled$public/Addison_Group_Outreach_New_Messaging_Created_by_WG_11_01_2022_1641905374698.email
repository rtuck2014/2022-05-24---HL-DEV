<br />
I am writing from Houlihan Lokey, a global investment bank where our Human Capital Management group specializes in working with businesses in the Staffing &amp; Recruiting space. We look to build long-term relationships, give advice on a wide range of topics and offer help where we can, connecting companies to funding solutions, and maximizing future growth and valuations.<br />
<br />
As you may have seen, we recently advised&nbsp;<span style="line-height:normal"><b><span style="color:black">Addison Group</span></b><span style="color:black">, a leading professional services firm specializing in talent solutions and consulting services, on its sale to <b>Trilantic North America</b>.&nbsp;<i>(Press release below)</i></span></span><br />

<span style="font-size:9px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"><i>* Selected transactions were executed by Houlihan Lokey professionals while at other firms.</i></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">We maintain conversations with companies across the sector and frequently work with companies which may represent interesting partnership or acquisition opportunities for you. Alongside this, our financial sponsors coverage team is the largest in investment banking, working closely with over 800 alternative investors. We are well-placed to connect you with alternative sources of funding.<br />
<br />
We would be delighted to hear your story directly, share our knowledge of the market and explore how we may be helpful to you.<br />
<br />
Best wishes,<br />
