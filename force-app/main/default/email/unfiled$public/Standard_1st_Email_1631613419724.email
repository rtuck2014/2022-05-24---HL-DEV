<br />
Congratulations on X and the continued success of your business.<br />
<br />
I am writing from Houlihan Lokey, a global investment bank, where our X group specializes in working with businesses in the X space. I wanted to reach out and propose a 30 minute introductory call.<br />
<br />

<br />

<span style="font-size:10px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><i>* Selected transactions were executed by Houlihan Lokey professionals while at other firms.</i></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;">We maintain conversations with companies across your sector and frequently work with companies which may represent interesting acquisition opportunities for you. Alongside this, our financial sponsors coverage team is the largest in investment banking, working closely with over 800 alternative investors. We are well-placed to connect you with alternative sources of funding.<br />
<br />
<span lang="EN-US">I also wanted to draw your attention to Houlihan Lokey’s new initiative that focuses on female-led businesses and is led by Alexandra Lebenthal, please see a short bio below. It addresses the opportunity and importance of providing investment banking services, industry relationships, and growth opportunities to female entrepreneurs and business owners around the globe.</span><br />
<br />
We’d be delighted to personally introduce ourselves, share our current insights into the market and learn more about your ambitions for {{{Recipient.Company_Name__c}}}.<br />
<br />
With this in mind, please let me know when you might have availability for a quick call with a senior member of our team&nbsp;<span lang="EN-US">and Ms. Lebenthal.</span><br />
<br />
Best wishes,<br />
<br />
