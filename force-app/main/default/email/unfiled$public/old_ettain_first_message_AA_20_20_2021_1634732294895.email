<br />
I am writing from Houlihan Lokey, a global investment bank, where our Business Services group specializes in working with companies in the X space. We look to build long-term relationships, give advice on a wide range of topics and offer help where we can, connecting companies to funding solutions, and maximizing future growth and valuations.<br />
