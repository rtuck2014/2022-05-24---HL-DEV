&nbsp;<br />
I am following up from my previous two e-mails to see whether you’d be interested in having a brief introductory conversation with our senior team at Houlihan Lokey.<br />
<br />
We are impressed with the business you have built and would love to learn more about your story and your plans going forward.<br />
<br />
If I don’t hear back from you then I appreciate that you are either very busy or are not interested. However, if you are interested then please let me know and we can schedule a meeting at your convenience.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Best wishes,<br />
