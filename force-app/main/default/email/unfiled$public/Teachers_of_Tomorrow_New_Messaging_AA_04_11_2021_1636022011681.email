<br />
<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;">We would love to hear the&nbsp;{{{Recipient.Company_Name__c}}}&nbsp;story, share our knowledge of the market and explore how we can be helpful. We would also like to introduce you to Alexandra Lebenthal, a former CEO who has recently joined Houlihan Lokey to lead an initiative focused on female-led businesses. This initiative is designed to provide investment banking services, industry relationships and growth opportunities to female entrepreneurs and business owners.<br />
<br />
Would a conversation with our senior team and Alexandra be of interest?<br />
<br />
Best,<br />
