<body style="height: auto; min-height: auto;"><span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Georgia,Times New Roman,Times,serif;">Dear {{{Recipient.FirstName}}},<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I am writing from Houlihan Lokey, a global investment bank, where our Industrials group specializes in working with businesses in the Industrial Technology space, with a particular focus on the electronic components landscape. We've closed over 6 deals this year in the electronic components sector and continue to be extremely active in the market.<br />
<br />
We look to build long-term relationships, provide advice on a wide range of topics and offer assistance where we can, connecting companies to funding solutions and maximizing future growth and valuations.<br />
