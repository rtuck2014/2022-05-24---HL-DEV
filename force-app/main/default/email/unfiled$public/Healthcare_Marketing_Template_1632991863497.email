<span style="font-size:14px;"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;"> We have been incredibly active in the space over the past two years and would be happy to share the unique perspective we’ve garnered having advised on more of the&nbsp;transactions of scale in the space than anyone else. We’d be happy to walk you through some of the specific buyer appetites, key attributes of focus for that buyer set and anything else that might be helpful for you to hear about as you think about your long-term strategy.<br />
<br />
We would love to hear the&nbsp;{{{Recipient.Company_Name__c}}}&nbsp;story, share our knowledge of the market and explore how we can be helpful. Would a conversation with our senior team be of interest?<br />
<br />
Best,<br />
