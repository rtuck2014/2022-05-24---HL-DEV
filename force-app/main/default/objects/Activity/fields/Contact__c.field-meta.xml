    <description>As of Winter 16 release, we can now add lookup fields to Events.  This field was added to make it easier to pull in contact details via a lookup.  The WhoId cannot be used as it is a polymorphic lookup field and doesn&apos;t allow you to use it as a true relationship field.</description>
